# Unreal 5.2+ Clangd extension for VSCode (Intellisense+)

`New update July 23rd, 2024`

Extension v2.5.1: For Unreal 5.2 and newer releases (Including 5.4+)

This version now uses Native project Intellisense files instead of using the UBT's mode `GenerateClangDataBase`.

For users who already have created a project using extension versions previous to `v2.5.0`, you'll need to run the "`Create Unreal Clangd Project`" command again and choose `Full` so that it overwrites old project settings. You shouldn't have to uninstall anything.

## Important Info

This extension now uses UBT to  `Refresh your project` to update Intellisense files(compile commands). So this runs when you run the `'Update Compile Commands'` command.
Since this refreshes your project, your code-workspace will be refreshed removing your clangd settings and others! but...

This extension will `automatically backup and restore` your clangd settings when you run the `Update Compile Commands` command.

`Note:` I've added a setting that allows you to add additional settings to be backed up.
See change log for more info: https://github.com/boocs/unreal-clangd/blob/v2/CHANGELOG.md#250-2024-05-05

## Quick Start Guide (UE 5.2+)
This is generally correct, when using  non-full source, but your situation could be different.

1. Read the [Requirements](https://github.com/boocs/unreal-clangd/tree/v2#readme) section of the full Documentation
    - Different Unreal Engine versions require different LLVM versions(Unreal 5.3/5.4 requires LLVM 16.0.6)

  ---

2. Install the vsix file from this github

- Click the extensions icon
- Click the ellipsis (3 dots)
- Choose Install from VSIX...

3. Ignore any VSCode warning messages (should go away after creating a project)

4. `Linux:` In the next step(project creation), File Dialogues will spawn behind VSCode(known bug)

  ---

5. Run extension command "Create Unreal clangd project" on your Unreal project
    - Example:

## Documentation
### Unreal 5.2+
`Note:` Make sure to read requirements! Different Unreal version usually require different `clang/clangd` and `XCode` versions

`Windows Users:` The requirements sections has `easy` instructions on how to install different Build Tools 2022 versions. These are required because other versions may cause `fake red error squiggles`.
